Splotch is written in the C++ language. To install it you have just to
1) unpack the tar.gz
2) Edit the Makefile
3) "make"

Please Check your compiler for the OpenMP flags if you want to use
OpenMP functionality (-fopenmp for g++).

If you have an MPI environment installed, you can also enable
the USE_MPI option.

To run it on your simulations, have a look into the demo.par
file and set the parameters you prefer.

If you want to visualize simulations created by the Gadget code
(http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~volker/gadget/index.html),
you will have to set the Gadget parameter SnapFormat = 2.
Endian conversion will be performed if requested in the Splotch parameter file.
