UNITS:
All models will be created in internal units, ranging from -1 to 1.
Models based on images will scale the images to fit into these coordinates.

COMPONENTS:
So far, once can compose the model out of uop to 6 components, which are 
specified by their names. The names are just are an extension to all
teh parameters and do not specify what model to use for them:
"Gas","Bulge","Disk","GCluster","Stars","BHs"


MODELS:
0: No model (absent)
Do<COMPONENT> = 0

1: Spherical component  (for exampel bulge)
Do<COMPONENT> = 1
N<COMPONENT>=1000000      # Number of particles to create
Sigmax<COMPONENT>=0.3     # With of exponential distribution in x direction
Sigmay<COMPONENT>=0.3     # With of exponential distribution in y direction
Sigmaz<COMPONENT>=0.005   # With of exponential distribution in z direction
hsml<COMPONENT>=0.0001    # Size for the particles to use

2: Distribution of spherical Components (like globular clusters)
Do<COMPONENT>GCluster=2
N<COMPONENT>=10000        # Total number of particles to create
Nmaxper<COMPONENT>=500    # Number of particles for each object
                          # => Nuber of objects = N<COMPONENT>/Nmaxper<COMPONENT>
Sigmax<COMPONENT>=0.1     # With of exponential distribution in x direction
Sigmay<COMPONENT>=0.1     # With of exponential distribution in y direction
Sigmaz<COMPONENT>=0.1     # With of exponential distribution in z direction
Sigma<COMPONENT>=0.005    # With of exponential distribution within each object
hsml<COMPONENT>=0.0001    # Size for the particles to use

3: Stellar disk component, defined by Sigma_z and colored/cutted from images
Do<COMPONENT>=3
N<COMPONENT>=10000000     # Maximum number of particles to possible create
NperPixel<COMPONENT>=100  # Number of particles to create per defined pixel in the mask
InFileType<COMPONENT>=1   # 0: read .bmp file     1: read raw .dat file 
<COMPONENT>xres=2700      # number of pixels in the x direction
<COMPONENT>yres=2700      # number of pixels in the y direction
<COMPONENT>FileRGB=<file> # File containg the color information (RGB)
<COMPONENT>FileMask=<file># File containg the mask information (Grayscale)
hsml<COMPONENT>=0.0001    # Size for the particles to use

4: Gas disk component, defined by Sigma_z (modulated by mask) and colored/cutted from images
Do<COMPONENT>=4
N<COMPONENT>=10000000     # Maximum number of particles to possible create
NperPixel<COMPONENT>=100  # Number of particles to create per defined pixel in the mask
Sigmaz<COMPONENT>=0.1     # With factor for exponential distribution in z direction
Sigmazfixed<COMPONENT>=0.1# Minimum with of exponential distribution in z direction
                          # => width = (Sigmazfixed<COMPONENT> + mask) * Sigmaz<COMPONENT>
InFileType<COMPONENT>=1   # 0: read .bmp file     1: read raw .dat file 
<COMPONENT>xres=2700      # number of pixels in the x direction
